# 30-Day SQL Plan

Iâ€™m deliberately leveling up my SQL. Clear goals, small daily reps, and real queries.

## Focus Areas

1. Schema design: types, constraints, normalization vs. pragmatism
2. Indexing: B-tree basics, composite indexes, covering indexes
3. Joins: inner/left/right, anti-joins, set operations
4. Query plans: `EXPLAIN`, costs, spotting bad scans

## Weekly Outline

- Week 1: Modeling + constraints on a small app
- Week 2: Index design from real query patterns
- Week 3: Join exercises and edge cases
- Week 4: Profiling with `EXPLAIN` and refactors

## Artifact

Ship a small SQLite-backed feature in this portfolio using SQLModel.
