# Why FastAPI + HTMX

I wanted to ship a clean, fast, accessible portfolio. FastAPI gives me a great developer experience and performance. HTMX lets me sprinkle interactivity without a front-end framework.

## Priorities

- Keep HTML small and accessible.
- Avoid heavy client-side state.
- Reuse Python skills end-to-end.

## What worked well

- Jinja2 templates for clear, semantic markup.
- HTMX for small enhancements (filters, forms).
- Simple JSON storage with a path to SQLite/SQLModel.

## Whatâ€™s next

Move to SQLite (SQLModel), add richer admin, and keep the UI pragmatic.
