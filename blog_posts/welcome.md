# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio site! I'm excited to share my journey as a backend developer specializing in Python and FastAPI.

## About This Site

This portfolio is built with:

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast Python web framework
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for dynamic HTML rendering
- **HTMX**: For seamless, dynamic interactions without complex JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for clean, responsive design

## What I'm Working On

I'm currently focused on:

1. **Backend Development**: Building robust APIs with FastAPI
2. **SQL Skills**: Learning database design and optimization
3. **Modern Web Technologies**: Exploring HTMX and other tools for efficient web development

## Future Plans

I'm planning to migrate this portfolio from JSON storage to **SQLite** for better data management and querying capabilities. This will be a great opportunity to apply my growing SQL skills!

Stay tuned for more updates and projects!
